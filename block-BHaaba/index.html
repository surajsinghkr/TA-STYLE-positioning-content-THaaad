                    <p>This Mahindra Scorpio has been modified by DC Design and looks really impressive. The Mahindra Scorpio has always been one of the most robust-looking SUVs around. First launched in 2002, the Scorpio was not expected to become such a popular vehicle among Indian SUV enthusiasts, but it certainly managed to do so. Even though the Scorpio has been around for quite some time now, it has never lost its charm among the Indian auto buyers. The SUV is such a practical vehicle that it is suitable for many purposes: from city driving to off-roading. The decent performance of the vehicle, thanks to its 4WD system and a low ratio gearbox, is one of the unique selling points of the Mahindra Scorpio. The vehicle’s appearance is somewhat intimidating which gives it a great road presence.</p>

                    <p>DC Avanti is a car that has been under development for a long time. In fact ZigWheels was the first publication in India to drive the car back in 2012 when it was a very basic prototype and had quite a few good things to say about it. Now though, it is very close to being launched and we finally get our hands on what seem to be very close to the car that will actually be available in India in the next few months.I personally have waited for a really long time to get behind the wheel of this car, mainly because of the fact that you can easily be surprised at the level of potential some small automobile manufacturers can bring to the table.Of course, this isn’t the first sports car to be indigenously built in India (that would be the San Storm which was available in the late 90s), but it is the first mid-engined sportscar that an Indian automobile manufacturer has built.</p>

                    <p>The Amberoid concept got the same design language as the original Hindustan Ambassador but in a much modern way. The three-box design was carried forward to the concept. However, the Amberoid received a lot of curvy lines and a sweeping bonnet design that added a touch of futuristic design. Nonetheless, the Amberoid did look like a modern-day Ambassador. The car sat on a BMW chassis, and featured a massive, V12 petrol engine.Since it was only a concept, DC Design added massive alloy wheels filling out the flared wheel arches of the vehicle. The headlamps used in the vehicle were all-LED just like the tail lamps. It was a two-door four-seater vehicle that was mainly targeted at the politicians and enthusiasts who want to own a piece of history in its modern avatar.</p>
