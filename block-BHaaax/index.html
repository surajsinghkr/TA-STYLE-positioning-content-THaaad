                    <h2>Next Generation Audi Electic Cars</h2>
                    <p>Audi's electric-vehicle strategy currently relies on the launch of new nameplates, the most recent of which is the Q4 E-Tron. However, the automaker will eventually introduce electric versions of existing nameplates, and the next A4 due around 2023 may be the first avenue. Citing anonymous sources, Autocar reported on Monday that Audi's next A4 will be topped by two electrified models, one of which will be a battery-electric model. The other is reported to be a plug-in hybrid RS 4. Interestingly, the pure electric model is also reported to be coming with an RS badge. There will also be non-RS electric A4s, according to Autocar's sources.</p>
